##Surprise Housing â€“ Australian Market House Price Prediction
Overview

Surprise Housing, a US-based housing company, is planning to enter the Australian real estate market. The company uses data analytics to identify properties that can be purchased below market value and sold for a profit.

This project builds a regression model with regularization (Ridge and Lasso) to predict house prices using a dataset of Australian property sales. The model helps the company:

Identify significant variables affecting house prices.

Quantify how these variables influence the price.

Determine the optimal regularization parameter (lambda) for Ridge and Lasso regression.

Business Goal

Predict the actual value of prospective properties.

Enable management to strategically invest in areas that maximize returns.

Understand pricing dynamics in a new market to make informed decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project is included in this repository:  
[Dataset CSV](./train.csv)

Methodology

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables (if any).

Scale features as required.

Model Building

Ridge Regression: To reduce multicollinearity and regularize coefficients.

Lasso Regression: To perform feature selection and identify significant variables.

Optimal Lambda Selection: Used cross-validation to find the best regularization parameter.

Model Evaluation

Metrics: R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Interpretation of coefficients to understand variable impact.

Key Features

Price of the house (dependent variable)

Independent variables include:

Location-based features

Size (e.g., square footage)

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Other relevant property attributes

Actual feature names should match those in the dataset.

Tools & Libraries

Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook / Python script for modeling and analysis
